# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. During the creation of this project, I connected the server to a database, managed error handling, used the CRUD method, code structuring using controllers, routers, annd models. On top of that, I implemented the use of lint and started on the process of an express application. This functionality will allow the server to create items/users, delete items, like/dislike items, gather the items, and be able to find a user striclty by ID.
## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
